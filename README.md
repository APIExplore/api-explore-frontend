## Background

APIs are everywhere, we need often to understand their behaviour. Either as
developers of the API, or as users of it, when developing another application.
Moreover, APIâ€™s expose functionality of our system to the outside world and are thus
important to be thoroughly tested.

Our project provides a demonstrator that allows users to explore and visualize API interactions.
This demonstrator is especially useful for understanding and testing the behavior of your APIs,
making it a valuable asset for developers and researchers alike.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this application are:

1. **Simulate Events:** Simulate events and API interactions to understand system behavior.

2. **Visualize API Interactions:** Showcase API interactions with visualizations, making it easier to comprehend complex
   systems.

3. **Interact with the System Under Test:** Enable users to interact with the system under test, allowing for testing
   and exploration.

## Features

- **Timeline Visualization:** View a timeline of API calls, their durations, responses, and more.
- **Relationship Visualization:** Visualize relationships between operations and parameters in API calls.
- **System Control:** Take control of the system under test, including functions like restarting, sending API calls, and
  extracting essential information such as log files.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API Exploration and Testing Demonstrator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `yarn install`.
3. Run the application using `npm run dev`.
4. Start exploring and interacting!
